"""
Merge sort algorithm follows the divide-and-cinquer paradigm. It operates as follows:

Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into two subsequences of n/2 elements each.

Conquer: Sort the sequence recursively using merge sort.

Combine: Combine the two sorted subsequences to produce the answer.

Time complexity:
        Best : O(n log(n))
        Average : O(n log(n))
        Worst : O(n log(n))

Space complexity: O(n)

Algorithmic Paradigm: Divide and Conquer

Sorting In Place: No in a typical implementation

Stable: Yes
