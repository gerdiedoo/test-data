Binary search algorithm, iterative implementation.

A binary search is a method to quickly find a given item in a sorted
list. It's important the input list is sorted, or the binary search
algorithm won't be useful at all. Sorted lists are things like
alphabets (because "A" is always before "B," and so on), or number
lines (because "1" is always before "2," and so on).

    Return the index of ``item`` in ``stuff`` using binary search.

    Args:
        stuff (list): A Python list that has already been sorted.
        item: The value of the item to search for (not its index).

    Returns:
        The index of ``item`` or ``None`` if ``item`` is not found.

    list indexes start counting from position number 0, not number 1.
